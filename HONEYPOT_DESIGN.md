# üçØ Honeypot Design Documentation

## Intentional Vulnerabilities (NOT BUGS!)

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Location**: Admin dashboard, login forms
- **Purpose**: Attract web application attackers
- **Monitoring**: All XSS attempts logged with payload analysis

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials
- **Credentials**: `admin/password123`, `root/admin`  
- **Purpose**: Bait for credential stuffing attacks
- **Note**: These are FAKE - real admin uses secure authentication

### 3. Missing Authentication
- **Routes**: `/admin`, `/logs`, `/export`
- **Purpose**: Lure attackers to "sensitive" areas
- **Reality**: All fake data, real admin is at `/security-console-x7k9`

### 4. SQL Injection Points
- **Location**: Login forms, search parameters
- **Purpose**: Attract database attackers
- **Safety**: Uses SQLite with dummy data only

## Real Security (Protected Areas)

### Actual Admin Console
- **Path**: `/security-console-x7k9` (randomized)
- **Auth**: Session-based with secure tokens
- **Purpose**: Real monitoring and analysis

### Data Protection
- **Real Data**: Stored separately from honeypot
- **Isolation**: Honeypot runs in contained environment
- **Monitoring**: All interactions logged and analyzed

## Attack Analysis Features

### AI-Powered Detection
- Sentiment analysis of attack payloads
- Bot vs human classification
- Social engineering pattern recognition

### Threat Intelligence
- IP reputation scoring
- Geolocation tracking
- Attack campaign correlation

## Interview Talking Points

1. **"These vulnerabilities are intentional honeypot features"**
2. **"Real admin system is completely separate and secure"**
3. **"Every 'vulnerability' is monitored and analyzed"**
4. **"AI classifies attack sophistication and intent"**
5. **"System provides valuable threat intelligence data"**
